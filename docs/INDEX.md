# CastelDazur CI Monitor — Public Docs Index (Sanitized)

This public repository documents the build-in-public journey of CastelDazur Systems: a local-first CI monitor where claims require evidence and exports require approval gates.

> This public set is intentionally sanitized. It explains principles, outputs, and boundaries without revealing operational details, sources, or client data.

---

## What this repo is
A competitive intelligence monitor designed around:
- Evidence-first: no proof → no claim
- Governance: approval gate before export/download
- Local-first: runs on your hardware by default
- Honest limits: explicit Coverage Report

---

## What this repo is NOT
- Not a scraping toolkit
- No CAPTCHA bypass
- No "robots.txt tricks"
- No outbound telemetry by default
- No client/source disclosure in public logs

---

## Public deliverables (promise)
- Executive Summary: EN + FR (required)
- Opportunity/Threat Backlog: EN (MVP)
- Evidence Index + Change Log
- Coverage Report (honest limitations)
- Approval Gate (review before export)

---

## Public build log
We publish weekly, sanitized progress updates:
- docs/updates/ — weekly notes
- GitHub Issues with label weekly-log — short logs + decisions

---

## Public docs (sanitized)
Start here:
- docs/README_PUBLIC.md — product overview and positioning
- docs/POLICY_PUBLIC.md — what we do / what we refuse to do (ethics & compliance)
- docs/OUTPUTS_PUBLIC.md — what an MVP report contains (structure only)
- docs/SECURITY_PUBLIC.md — threat model summary (high-level, no tactics)

*(These files are created step-by-step. If some are missing, they're simply not published yet.)*
