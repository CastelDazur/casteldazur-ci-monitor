# Glossary (Public, Sanitized)

A quick reference for core terms used in CastelDazur CI Monitor.

---

## Backlog (Opportunity / Threat)
A structured list of actionable items derived from observations.
Each item includes impact/confidence and a suggested next action.

---

The core workflow is designed to run local-first.

- what was checked
- what could not be checked (and why)
- what is out of scope
Purpose: honesty and correct decision-making.

---

## Evidence
A proof artifact used to support a factual statement.
Public docs describe evidence conceptually; operational details remain private.

## Evidence Index
A structured list of evidence artifacts referenced by the run's claims and changes.
Purpose: auditability (proof mapping).

---

## Inference

Must be labeled as inference (not presented as a verified fact).

A captured representation of a source at a point in time (conceptually).
Used to support evidence-first reporting.

---

## Threat / Opportunity
- Threat: a change that increases risk or reduces advantage
- Opportunity: a change that opens a path to gain advantage

## Trust boundary
The separation between what is public/sanitized and what remains private/confidential.
Public repo is a "vitrine"; private repo holds full operational details.
