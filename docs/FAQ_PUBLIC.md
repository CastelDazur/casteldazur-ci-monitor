# FAQ (Public, Sanitized)

Short answers to the most common questions about CastelDazur CI Monitor.

---

## Is this a scraping tool?
No. CI Monitor is a governed reporting workflow.
It focuses on evidence, honest coverage, and approval gates.

We do not build or publish:
- CAPTCHA bypass
- robots restrictions evasion
- stealth collection designed to avoid detection

If a source cannot be accessed compliantly, it becomes a coverage gap, not a target.

---

## What makes CI Monitor different from "normal CI"?
Most CI fails due to:
- missing proof
- unverifiable claims
- hidden blind spots

CI Monitor enforces:
- no proof → no claim
- a Coverage Report
- Change Log + Evidence Index
- an Approval Gate before export

It is designed to be auditable and decision-ready.

---

## Why local-first / on-prem?
Because it gives teams:
- control of sensitive workflows
- predictable performance baseline
- fewer data-movement risks

Cloud is opt-in only.

---

## Why do you mention a GPU baseline?
Because modern workflows (summaries, comparisons, classification, future agent modules) require predictable throughput.
A GPU baseline helps keep weekly runs stable as scope grows.

---

## What do I actually receive each week?
MVP package:
- Executive Summary (**EN + FR required**)
- Opportunity/Threat Backlog (EN MVP)
- Change Log
- Evidence Index
- Coverage Report
- Approval Record (export gate)

---

## Do you guarantee full coverage?
No — and we don't pretend to.
Every run includes a Coverage Report listing what we could not verify.

---

## Do you publish competitor/source lists in public?
No.
Public materials are sanitized:
- no domains/URLs/source lists
- no client names
- no configs, limits, allowlists, fingerprints
- no secrets, tokens, keys

---

## Can I run this on my own hardware?
Yes — that's the default philosophy.
A private pilot is run on your infrastructure (on-prem / local-first).

---

## How do I request a pilot?
Open a GitHub issue titled:
**"Pilot request — CI Monitor"**

Keep details high-level in public.
If needed, we will continue privately.

---

## What's the build-in-public cadence?
Weekly sanitized updates:
- docs/updates/
- Issues labeled weekly-log

We share progress without exposing confidential or operational details.
