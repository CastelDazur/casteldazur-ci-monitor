# Public Report Templates (Sanitized)

These templates show the structure of CI Monitor outputs (MVP).
They are intentionally sanitized:
- no sources/domains/URLs
- no operational IDs, configs, limits, or fingerprints
- no client details

Use them as:
- a formatting baseline
- a demo pack using synthetic/mock inputs
- a governance reference (what must exist in every run)

Templates included:
- Executive Summary (EN)
- Executive Summary (FR)
- Opportunity/Threat Backlog (EN)
- Change Log
- Evidence Index (structure only)
- Coverage Report
- Approval Record (export gate)
