# Evidence Index (Structure Only)

This is a sanitized structure template.
Do not publish sources/domains/URLs in public materials.

| Evidence ID | Artifact type | Timestamp | Integrity check | Claim mapping (internal) | Notes |
|------------|---------------|----------:|-----------------|--------------------------|------|
| EV-001 | Snapshot | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | Present | Private mapping |  |
| EV-002 | Snapshot | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | Present | Private mapping |  |

## Rules
- Every factual claim maps to at least one evidence item (internally).
- Evidence items are time-stamped and tamper-evident (conceptually).
- Public materials may reference evidence categories, not sources.
