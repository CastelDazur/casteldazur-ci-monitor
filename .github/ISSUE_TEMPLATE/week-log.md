> 🛡️ **Sanitize rules (remove this block before posting):**
> 1. No clients/competitors/URLs/niches/countries/admin screenshots — replace with Client A / Competitor 1 / SourceGroup X / "demo/sanitized".
> 2. No secrets or configs: keys, tokens, policy-yaml, allowlist/denylist, limit params, internal paths/servers — only general principles ("cloud opt-in", "robots hard stop", "approval gate").
> 3. Publish only "engineering form": what shipped (1–3 points), what broke (no source details), decision/lesson, next week + 1 visual with no sensitive data (hardware photo/diagram/anonymized evidence index).
