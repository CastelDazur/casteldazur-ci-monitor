# CastelDazur CI Monitor
**CastelDazur Systems** builds local-first AI systems on your hardware.  
This public repo is the sanitized build-in-public vitrine for our first product: CI Monitor.

> Public materials are intentionally sanitized: no client data, no source lists/domains/URLs, no operational configs, limits, allowlists, or fingerprints.

## What this is
A weekly competitive intelligence workflow designed for traceability and governance:
- No proof → no claim
- Coverage Report (honest limits, explicit unknowns)
- Approval gate before export/share

---

## MVP outputs (public promise)
Every run produces a structured package:
- Executive Summary: EN + FR (required)
- Opportunity/Threat Backlog: EN (MVP)
- Change Log
- Evidence Index (structure; operational details remain private)
- Coverage Report
- Approval Record (export gate)

Optional later by policy: RU/DE.

---

## What we do NOT do
Hard boundaries:
- No CAPTCHA bypass
- No robots evasion ("robots hard stop")
- No stealth/covert collection designed to avoid detection
- No outbound telemetry by default
- Cloud is opt-in only (default off)

If something cannot be accessed compliantly, it becomes a coverage gap, not a target.
