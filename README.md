# CastelDazur CI Monitor
**CastelDazur Systems:** local-first AI systems on your hardware — evidence-based CI with governance.

## What this is
A weekly competitive intelligence monitor where every claim is backed by evidence:
- HTML snapshot + timestamp + hash (no proof → no claim)
- Coverage Report (honest limits)
- Approval gate before export/download

## MVP outputs (public promise)
- Executive Summary: EN + FR (required)
- Opportunity/Threat Backlog: MVP = EN
- Change Log, Evidence Index, Coverage Report
- RU/DE optional by policy

## What we do NOT do
- No CAPTCHA bypass
- Robots hard stop
- No outbound telemetry by default
- Cloud is opt-in only (default off)

## Build log
I'll post weekly progress updates here (sanitized) + visuals (hardware, diagrams, demo assets).
